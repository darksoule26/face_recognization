It is a simple Face recognization software using python. I have used various libraries like opencv, facerecognize, etc.. 
This code provides a database where you can store the basic data images of people.
When the code is runed the software will open a UI where if you are in the database then a message is displayed "YOUR ATTENDANCE IS MARKED", with your name and details.
If you are a unknown person a message will be displayed "UNKNOWN" and the attendance wont be marked .
The attendance is getting stored in text file which is been done using file handling concepts
